Malaria is a major problem in many parts of the world, malaria is a life-threatening disease 
Spread to humans by mosquitoes. Since malaria is both preventive and curable. Malaria can be 
Prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicine. Treatment can stop mild cases from 
Getting worse. Symptoms include fever, chills, and headache. as a challenge for rural farmers
 
The following are the subproblems of malaria; 

Stagnant water provides a breeding ground for the vector that transmits malaria. Draining areas 
Where stagnant water is filled up helps to destroy breeding grounds for malaria. Proper disposal 
Of waste like plastic bottles, discarded tires, and all other materials that may act as reservoirs. 
This helps to create no room for the breeding of the vector. Having proper drainage patterns and clearing stagnant water points reduce the breeding grounds for the vector.
 
Lack of education and awareness; this is limited knowledge of prevention, symptoms, and the 
Importance of seeking early treatment. Through mhealth users will be well-educated and 
Informed about the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention ways. Continuous communication and sending of information about all malaria-related programs to keep up with all the necessary information. This will help the people be well informed and have better preventive measures compared to treatment issues.  
 
Late detection; causes acute suffering in a patient due to malaria due to ignorance about 
Symptoms. Through mhealth a user will be in a position to survive in their state of health by 
Taking a diagnostic test and being in a position to know one malaria status and when positive be 
Able to recommend treatment. This helps them with the timely treatment of malaria.
